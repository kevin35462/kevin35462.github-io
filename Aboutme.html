        <h6>So if their is <span class="red">one</span> thing i like the most about coding is the ability to learn by <span class="red">yourself</span>. I'm pretty sure everything is being googled nowadays. Even professionals google code that they may have forgot. It's <span class ="red">awesome</span> that all the resources are
            already given to you. If one thing i am is an <span class = "red">independent</span> learner. In school i've always preferred working alone because i feel like i get more out of my time. Regardless i still much <span class="red">enjoy</span> coding with others. People have amazing ideas and
            it's nice to see them open up and say their mind. I have been coding since the beginning of my sophomore year of high school and now i am arrving the end of my junior year. Where my time mostly went was coding and computers. Gotta <span class = "red">love</span> it.</h6>
